A mathematical model of neuroimmune interactions in epileptogenesis for discovering treatment strategies. aa. 2023-2024

Description and simulation of the course of acquired epilepsy development caused by the most common types of neural injuries using a single parameter set. It accounts for the complex epileptogenic role of neuroimmune interactions. It suggests an explanation for the the reason why development of epilepsy may take months or years after the triggering injury in certain cases.  It provides insights into the general principles of EPG and allows us to generate testable predictions for different therapeutic strategies.
